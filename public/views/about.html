    <h1>About me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I am an artist, designer and front end developer.
      <br><br>
      I was born in Italy but grew up in Tel Aviv. I moved to London 7 years ago to do my MA in Sculpture at the Royal College of Art.
      I graduated in 2013, it was amazing.
      <br><br>
      I then feel in love with web design and code and life lead me to <a href="http://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a>.
      Founders & Coders is by far the best educational model and community I have ever been part of - a 16 weeks, free coding bootcamp full of amazing people, activists, dreamers and makers.
      I completed the Founders & Coders bootcamp in 2016 and stayed active in the community since then.
      <br><br>
      While I’m good on the front end side (and I love it!), I consider myself a designer. I am obsessed with all those little details that makes a digital experience absolutely awesome.
      I am fluent with various design tools such as Sketch, Photoshop and Illustrator. I  write HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
      I enjoy the entire process of design, from the initial idea to the meticulous composition of beautiful user interfaces.
      I am interested in people — what they love and value.
      <br><br>
      I am a UI and UX designer who also understand code and is not afraid to interact with all the various parts of a project.
      I value learning and trying over predicting. I love learning about different approaches to user centred design.
      <br><br>
      I am always looking for great collaborations and being part of creative communities.
